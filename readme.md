# Solving scripts for PortSwigger WebSecurity Academy

See great collection of resources and hacking labs over at `https://portswigger.net/web-security`.

Even if I am at the starting point of their collection, so far I really like it.
The part of the content I have seen so far, has high quality and their labs work great.

They really take you at the hand and show some interesting web security topics, step by step.
They give you the training wheels, but with their labs, you still can drive yourself.

There is just this one thing:
They expect that those labs are solved with their product `Burp Suite`.
Don't get me wrong, the Burp Suite is a great tool!
Go try it, if you don't know about it!
What I like the most about the academy:
It is free, but their business model is clear. There is no hidden agenda.
They offer a training ground for their product, go buy it.
I like this, because this will ensure great content for free.

With this repository, I will take another approach:
I will solve their challenges with self written scripts.
Probably mostly (if not all?) python.

This repository is mostly for personal future reference,
but if you find this, and if you find something useful,
feel free to use whatever you like.

## Contributions

The code in this repository reflects my own learning curve: It will get the job done, but will be far from perfect.
If you feel the need for comments, I would really appreciate them.

I am interested in alternative (probaly better) solutions for labs I have tackled myself.

I am *not* interested in new solutions to labs I have not tackled myself.
